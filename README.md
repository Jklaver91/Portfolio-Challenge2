## Description

The Challenge otwone assignment tasked us with creating a portfolio website using HTML as well as Advanced CSS learned during the week.

This was accomplished by using things like flexbox to design the site to be mobile friendly as well as using things like :root to create a design scheme to create a uniform color scheme.
